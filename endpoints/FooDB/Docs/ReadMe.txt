FooDB is the world’s largest and most comprehensive resource on food constituents, chemistry and biology. It provides information on
both macronutrients and micronutrients, including many of the constituents that give foods their flavor, color, taste, texture and 
aroma. Each chemical entry in the FooDB contains more than 100 separate data fields covering detailed compositional, biochemical and 
physiological information (obtained from the literature). This includes data on the compound’s nomenclature, its description, 
information on its structure, chemical class, its physico-chemical data, its food source(s), its color, its aroma, its taste, its 
physiological effect, presumptive health effects (from published studies), and concentrations in various foods. Users are able to 
browse or search FooDB by food source, name, descriptors, function or concentrations. Depending on individual preferences users are
able to view the content of FooDB from the Food Browse (listing foods by their chemical composition) or the Compound Browse (listing 
chemicals by their food sources). 

FooDB is a freely available, open-access database containing chemical composition data on common, unprocessed foods. It also contains 
extensive data on flavour and aroma constituents, food additives as well as positive and negative health effects associated with food 
constituents. The database contains information on more than 28,000 chemicals found in more than 1000 raw or unprocessed food products. 
The data in FooDB was collected from many sources including textbooks, scientific journals, on-line food composition or nutrient 
databases, flavour and aroma databases and various on-line metabolomic databases. This literature-derived information has been 
combined with experimentally derived data measured on thousands of compounds from more than 40 very common food products through 
the Alberta Food Metabolome Project which is led by Dr. David Wishart of the University of Alberta. Users are able to browse through 
the FooDB data by food source, name, descriptors or function. Chemical structures and molecular weights for compounds in FooDB 
may be searched via a specialized chemical structure search utility. Users are able to view the content of FooDB using two 
different “Viewing” options: FoodView, which lists foods by their chemical compounds, or ChemView, which lists chemicals by 
their food sources. Knowledge about the precise chemical composition of foods can be used to guide public health policies, 
assist food companies with improved food labelling, help dieticians prepare better dietary plans, support nutraceutical companies 
with their submissions of health claims and guide consumer choices with regard to food purchases.
