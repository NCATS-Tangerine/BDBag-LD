# bagit

We're adding semantic annotations via JSON-LD to the Bag-It specification.

See this post for a [brief introduction](https://greenncatstranslator.wordpress.com/2018/01/23/bag-it-update/).

With a JSON-LD annotated bag, we hope to generate executable OpenAPI and smartAPI specifications and implementations.
